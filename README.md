### TODO
* Global
  * Graphics
  * Sound
  * Clean-up everything!
  	* That also mean replace all the std::map of Inventory by two std::map with one with special struct instead of several map for nothing

* Optimization (if necessary)
  * Search where are the bottlenecks
  * ECS: Optimize to be more cache-friendly
