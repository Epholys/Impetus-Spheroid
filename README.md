# Impetus Spheroid
## A rapid-paced game about spheroid with high momentum and a target

### TODO
* Global
  * Graphics
  * Sound
  * Clean-up everything!
  	* That also mean replace all the std::map of Inventory by two std::map with one with special struct instead of several map for nothing

* Optimization (if necessary)
  * Search where are the bottlenecks
  * ECS: Optimize to be more cache-friendly


### Trivia
* Why didn't I use MVC pattern ? I didn't know its existence at the creation of this project, and it will take a long time to refactor everything into this principle. As my personal deadline is September 2015, I don't have enough time.
